**Hi, thanks for visiting my GitHub.**

I'm a graduate student in UChicago's Computational Analysis and Public Policy program ("CAPP"). I have a passion for data science, particularly using machine learning to solve 

Before CAPP I worked for 4 years for the Chilean Antitrust Agency working as a research economist for the merger division. During that time I need to carry out economic analysis combining theoretical and quantitative tools to asses the possible competitive effects of a proposed merger.

My policy interest lie mostly on competition policy, energy and sustainability, and urban policy, topics I'm most passionate about contributing to.
