**Hi, thanks for visiting my GitHub.**

I'm JP Martinez (He/Him), I'm a recent graduate from the program [Computational Analysis and Public Policy program ("CAPP")](https://capp.uchicago.edu) at The university of Chicago. I have a passion for data science, particularly using machine learning to solve problems on the public policy space. My policy interest lie mostly on competition policy, transportation policy and climate and energy.

Before CAPP I worked for 4 years for the Chilean Antitrust Agency as a research economist for the merger division. During that time I carried out economic analysis combining theoretical and quantitative tools to asses the possible competitive effects of proposed mergers.

**During my time in CAPP I worked in the following projects:**

- [Transit planning tool aimed to revitalize public interest and participation in transit, driving increased ridership and creating more efficient networks that meet urban community needs](https://github.com/uchicago-capp-30320/RouteRangers) 
- [Computer Vision project on predicting Pneumonia from X-Ray Image](https://github.com/JPMartinezClaeys/30254-pneumoniacs)
- [Understanding Black Lives Matters protests and their impact in relationship to media coverage and changes to municipal budgets.](https://github.com/JPMartinezClaeys/30122-project-protest)
- Webscrapping articles from the politics secion from US news media from 2016-2023 (repository is expected to be public soon, available upon request)
- [Topic modelling and sentiment analysis on news articles from news media politics section](https://github.com/meganhmoore/LingoQuartet)


Many repositories from school programming assignments are private for academic integrity and intellectual property purposes. Code can be shared with prospective employers upon request.
